## About
Personal finances are an important part of life. Sometimes you need some extra money and decide to take a loan, or you want to buy a house using a mortgage. To make an informed decision, you need to be able to calculate different financial parameters. Letâ€™s make a program that can help us with that!

## Examples

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that this is not part of the input.

### Example 1
calculating differentiated payments
```
> python creditcalc.py --type=diff --principal=1000000 --periods=10 --interest=10
Month 1: payment is 108334
Month 2: payment is 107500
Month 3: payment is 106667
Month 4: payment is 105834
Month 5: payment is 105000
Month 6: payment is 104167
Month 7: payment is 103334
Month 8: payment is 102500
Month 9: payment is 101667
Month 10: payment is 100834

Overpayment = 45837
```

### Example 2
calculate the annuity payment for a 60-month (5-year) loan with a principal amount of 1,000,000 at 10% interest
```
> python creditcalc.py --type=annuity --principal=1000000 --periods=60 --interest=10
Your annuity payment = 21248!
Overpayment = 274880
```

###Example 3
fewer than four arguments are given
```
> python creditcalc.py --type=diff --principal=1000000 --payment=104000
Incorrect parameters.
```

### Example 4
calculate differentiated payments given a principal of 500,000 over 8 months at an interest rate of 7.8%
```
> python creditcalc.py --type=diff --principal=500000 --periods=8 --interest=7.8
Month 1: payment is 65750
Month 2: payment is 65344
Month 3: payment is 64938
Month 4: payment is 64532
Month 5: payment is 64125
Month 6: payment is 63719
Month 7: payment is 63313
Month 8: payment is 62907

Overpayment = 14628
```

### Example 5
calculate the principal for a user paying 8,722 per month for 120 months (10 years) at 5.6% interest
```
> python creditcalc.py --type=annuity --payment=8722 --periods=120 --interest=5.6
Your loan principal = 800018!
Overpayment = 246622
```

### Example 6
calculate how long it will take to repay a loan with 500,000 principal, monthly payment of 23,000, and 7.8% interest
```
> python creditcalc.py --type=annuity --principal=500000 --payment=23000 --interest=7.8
It will take 2 years to repay this loan!
Overpayment = 52000
```
